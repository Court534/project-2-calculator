# Mini Project 2-50
To improve my coding skills in python I've set out to complete 50 mini projects of different varieties to really ground my knowledge. By doing this I'm trying to step away from the tutorials and throw myself into the deep end.

## Command line calculator 
This is a simple command line calculator. It will prompt you to select either Add, Subtrack, Multiply or Divide. It will then ask for for two numbers and depending on your selection it will carry out the selected operation.  

## Terminal Example
Welcome to my Python calculator!

You can Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide

Type what would you like to do?
<br>
1.Add (+)
<br>
2.Subtract (-)
<br>
3.Multiply (*)
<br>
4.Divide (/)

Type the number (1, 2, 3, 4) of the mathematical operation you would like to use: 4
Enter the first number: 4
Enter the second number: 4
4.0 / 4.0 = 1.0

Would you like do another calculation? (yes/no)
